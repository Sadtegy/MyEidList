# MyEidList ğŸ•Œâœ¨

**MyEidList** is a simple command line to-do list app made especially for Eid planning.

This is my very first to-do list app built using the Go programming language (Golang).  
Right now, it's a basic CLI (Command Line Interface) tool where I can add and view Eid-related tasks.

## Features
- Add tasks
- View task list

## What's Next?
As I keep learning Go, I plan to:
- Add the ability to delete or edit tasks  
- Save tasks between sessions  
- Maybe even build a web or mobile version later on!

Stay tuned â€“ this is just the beginning!

Made with ğŸ’» and â˜• while learning Go.
